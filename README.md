## Computer Animation
This is a animation of a human like skeleton for a Computer Animation class (COMP 477). It uses OpenGL with multiple tools such as GLUT and glm. Using this program, we create and play stored animations. It is mostly used as a mean to show the effect of different interpolation methods on animations.
